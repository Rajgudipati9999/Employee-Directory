# Employee Directory – Frontend Assignment (AJACKUS)

This is a responsive and interactive Employee Directory web app built using **HTML**, **CSS (Flexbox)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It includes core UI features like adding/editing employees, filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination — all without backend APIs, as per the assignment scope.

## How to Run the App

## Reflection

**Challenges Faced:**

- Understanding Freemarker usage in a frontend-only setup.
- Maintaining state with just in-memory JavaScript arrays (no backend, no localStorage).
- Building pagination that dynamically reflects filters and search results.
- Ensuring clean structure with minimal libraries (no frameworks used).

**What I’d improve:**

- Improve UI styling with CSS animations and transitions.
- Add localStorage to preserve data on refresh (not required here).
- Modularize JavaScript even more using ES modules if environment allowed.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Freemarker file structure (simulated injection)
